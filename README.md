- Xcode 16.2 or later for development

### Development Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit integration
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Combine for reactive programming
- **Event System**: Global event monitoring with NSEvent

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Xcode 16.2 or later
2. macOS 15.5 or later
3. MacBook with notch (recommended) or any Mac for development

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NotchUtility
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open NotchUtility.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run (⌘+R)

### First Run
1. The app will start as a background accessory (no dock icon)
2. Move your mouse to the top of the screen near the notch area
3. Click or hover over the notch to reveal the interface
4. Try dragging files from Finder onto the notch area
5. Access clipboard history through the Clipboard tab


### Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes and ensure they pass all checks
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request

### Quality Assurance
All pull requests automatically run through our CI/CD pipeline which includes:
- **SwiftLint**: Ensures code style consistency
- **Unit Tests**: Verifies core functionality works correctly  
- **UI Tests**: Validates user interface behavior
- **Multi-architecture**: Tests on both Intel and Apple Silicon (x86_64 and arm64)

The pipeline must pass before merging. You can run these checks locally:

```bash
# Install SwiftLint
brew install swiftlint

# Run linting
swiftlint lint

# Run tests (treating warnings as errors)
xcodebuild test -project NotchUtility.xcodeproj -scheme NotchUtility SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES
```

## 🗺 Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Temporary File Storage & Clipboard Management (✅ **COMPLETE**)
- **Phase 2**: System Integration & Media Controls (🔄 **PLANNING**)
- **Phase 3**: Productivity Suite (Calendar, Notes, App Launcher)
- **Phase 4**: Customization & Extensions
